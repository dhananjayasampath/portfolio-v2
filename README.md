# portfolio-v2
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases who I am, the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, my technical skills, and how to get in touch with me. The goal of this website is to present my work professionally and make it easy for clients, recruiters, or collaborators to learn more about me.
